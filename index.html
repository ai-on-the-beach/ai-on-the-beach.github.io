	<h1>Welcome to AI on the Beach!</h1>
	<p class="text-body left-column">
		Weâ€™re a group of conservationists dedicated to combating climate change & protecting vulnerable marine species through technology. Currently our group is applying AI to help researchers track sharks, dolphins, and reef conditions in the water to identify how temperature changes are affecting movement patterns.
	</p>
	<p class="text-body left-column">
		We have monthly meetups to discuss our projects and have guest speakers come to present on topics in Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Oceanography, and Marine Conservation.
